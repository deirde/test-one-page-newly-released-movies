# TEST - ONE PAGE NEWLY RELEASE MOVIES #

Specs
-----
The marketing department have asked you to design a one-page website to promote NOW TVâ€™s newly released movies.<br/>
The only requirement for this webpage is that it must include a list of all the newly released movies, including the title, box image and the price for each movie in both Pounds (GBP) and Euros (EUR).<br/>
The movies and prices may change over time, so the webpage should be using the API so that it is always up-to-date.<br/>
If no price is available for any given movie, the movie should not be shown at all.<br/>
If no image is available, you should instead show the placeholder image.

Note
----
This is a technical test.<br/>
TIME: 100 minutes.<br/>
